# tap-game-android
A single pager tapping game made with Kotlin. This is an attempt to make an Android game in a few hours without prior experience in Android development. In 2 days, my Google Developer account will be closed if I don't submit an app. I've been contemplating whether to use Flutter or Native (Kotlin) for my first ever production Android app, I chose the latter for now.
